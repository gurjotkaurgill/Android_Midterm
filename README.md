# Android_Midterm

Android App built with Android Studio Giraffe | 2022.3.1 Patch 2, as a Midterm project for Seneca College Mobile Development - Android course.

This app enables users to add products to a list which includes product name and an image.

This app asks the user for a permission to access camera and if granted, uses an implicit intent to the camera app for taking a picture which is received in the app.
If the user entered a product name and an image, and asks to save them, a new object (of Product class) is created and added to a list of Products.
The user can then also see all the products along with their images in another screen.
This screen also has a custom title and a back button to go to the main screen.

Menus have also been created in both the activities which provide the user another way of switching between activities.

Below are some screenshots from the app:
